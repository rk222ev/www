For navigating large folders I currently use [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][Ranger]]: "A VIM-inspired file manager
for the console". =Ranger= uses it's own file opener =Rifle=. This post show
how to by pass this and use =xdg-open=.

** Configuration
If you haven't used Ranger before the first step is to copy the default
configuration by running the command
#+begin_src shell
$ ranger --copy-config=all
#+end_src

This will copy the default files to your =~/.config/ranger/=.
#+begin_src
├── commands_full.py
├── commands.py
├── rc.conf
├── rifle.conf
└── scope.sh
#+end_src

I'm only interested of changing the commands that =ranger= invokes when I'm
opening files. That's done by editing =rifle.conf=
To only copy =rifle.conf= the invocations is:
#+begin_src shell
$ ranger --copy-config=rifle
#+end_src

Since I already use a work flow involving =xdg-open= this is my
command of choice. As i only have one rule, use =xdg-open= my =rifle.conf=
becomes a simple:

#+begin_src shell
file, else = xdg-open "$@"
#+end_src
