Apparently Hugo has support for org-mode now. This proved to be an
excellent opportunity to migrate away from my home brewed static site
generator Immotile. As I've changed jobs and started working with
Clojure full time I no longer needed Immotile to scratch my Clojure
itch. This meant that there has been no progress on Immotile for a
very long time. That fact together with the feeling that Immotile suffered from
feature creep, as I implemented a rather advanced Clojurescript and HTML
hot reloading using Figwheel, has led me to move away from Immotile.

Hopefully using Hugo will make it easier to write more as I find it rather
enjoyable and something that makes me think about the topic I'm
writing about in a deeper and more complete way. Allowing me to
structure my thoughts a lot better.

Who knows. Perhaps it'll work.
